# Tutor, learn to code or not

This Repo is the first try in creating a tutorial as introduction to programming.
The idea is to talk about the basics and do a small programming project just with the basics any procedural/scripting
language offers: variables, basic structures, loops and functions.

This is a living project and may change based on feedback from the classes or collaborators or future self (`Holi Borja del futuro!!`).

## How to start?

This project is separated in two parts.

### The structure

The folder `cls` (pronounced class) contains all the READMEs and the codes files to do the tutorial.
The folder `server` is a typescript Express server that can serve all the READMEs from the `cls` folder parsed for the tutorial user
to go through, following the links between .md files.

### Prerequisites

For this tutorial you need some basic things and other no so basic.

#### Basic things first

- A device able to access this file. For example a Nokia 3310 won't work (if you haven't performed the proper upgrade)
- A way to input stuff in your device (hands, pen, eye tracking device, mental powers, [the ability to talk to machines](#link to HEROES character)*)
- A way to read stuff from your device (eyes (and brain), voiceover, mental powers, [the ability to talk to machines](#link to HEROES character)*)
  - _\*the list is not exhaustive_
- Power on your device (for obvious reasons)
- Internet connection to download the repo if you haven't yet.

#### Not so basic things but still
The tutorial is written in Javascript as a programming language. The reason is that is a well known language with a good community support.
It's also the main programming language I've been using for the last 6 years, and I think it's syntax is similar to many common (or not so common) languages: 
Java, C, C++, C#, .NET, etc.
I started with python first as I think its syntax might be a little more friendly for newcomers, but... meh.

Once that's clear, let's start. You will need:

- A terminal application.
  - Windows: CMD, Powershell, GitBash, Bash for windows.
    - Strongly recommend at least one of the latter two. GitBash requires less configuration.
    - Other recommendations: Install a virtual machine with a Linux distribution (ex Ubuntu)
  - Linux: choose your own. I go with *Terminator*.
  - MacOS: choose your own. I go with *iTerm*.
- Node and NPM. You can see the instructions on how to get this [here](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=install%20nodejs)
- GIT. This is optional as you can do the tutorial from beginning to the end without know what-the-git is GIT.
  - I might include an optional chapter at the end.
  - Or maybe you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) to start with:

### Let's get started

If you are eager to start you tutorial just go to the `cls` folder and start reading. BUT, I recommend you to got to `server` first and read the README.md there.
UP TO YOU.
