# Server the MD

To start with the tutorial and the learning do the following.

- Open your terminal app.
- Go to the folder where the project is located and then to the server folder in the project
  - `cd path/to/your/folder`
  - Mine is in a folder called Projects in my home folder (the folder where the terminal opens by default) so I do this:
    - `cd Projects/tutor`
- Install the dependencies (only necessary the first time). It might take some minutes.
  - `npm install`
- Run the server
  - `npm run start`
- Visit the url the program shows in the terminal. Which by default should be:
  - [http:localhost:3000](http:localhost:3000)
